            <p>I’m Krishna Bhatia, a first-year student at S.S.T, driven by a passion for Computer Science Engineering. I initially learned about coding in eighth grade, when the COVID-19 lockdown gave me time to explore technology. Since then, joining competitions, working on projects, and taking on leadership roles have helped me build my technical skills and become a better problem-solver.</p>
